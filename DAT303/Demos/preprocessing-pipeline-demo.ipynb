    "## Demo: Data Pre-Processing in scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, data preprocessing refers to the preparation and transformation of raw data into a format that is suitable for machine learning algorithms. This process typically involves several steps, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling missing values, outliers, or other inconsistencies in the dataset. Scikit-learn provides tools for imputation of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling numerical features to ensure that they have similar scales. This is important for many machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on distance calculations or gradient descent optimization. Scikit-learn offers various scaling methods such as standardization (StandardScaler) and min-max scaling (MinMaxScaler).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting categorical features into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. This may involve techniques such as one-hot encoding (`OneHotEncoder`) or label encoding (`LabelEncoder`).\n",

    "## Creating Train-Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of splitting data into train and test sets is to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data. By training the model on a subset of the data (the training set) and then evaluating its performance on a separate subset (the test set), we can assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. This helps us understand whether the model has learned meaningful patterns from the data or if it\"s simply memorizing the training examples, which is the definition of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. By evaluating the model on a separate test set, we can detect overfitting. If the model performs significantly worse on the test set compared to the training set, it indicates that the model has overfit the training data, and adjustments may be needed to improve its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, machine learning models often have hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance. Splitting the data allows us to perform hyperparameter tuning on the training set while keeping the test set untouched. This helps prevent \"leakage\" of information from the test set into the model training process, which could lead to overly optimistic performance estimates.\n"
